# Caffero Backend

The repo represents a simple backend for a faculty assignment.

My task was to implement an API and database structure for a caf√©-ordering app.

ORM used: Hibernate

## Note:
  Why is there only 1 commit?
    - The repo was originally on the faculty's private GitLab then I had to manually transfer it to my personal GitHub.
